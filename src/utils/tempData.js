    description: `A man, along with his wife and six others, was arrested on Sunday by the police for allegedly beheading his cousin over a land dispute in Jharkhand’s Khunti.
    After beheading the victim, the 20-year-old man's friends took a selfie with the severed head, according to the police.
    The arrest was made following an FIR by the victim's father, Desai Munda, who claimed that his son, Kanu Munda, was alone at home on December 1 while he was out for work at a paddy field.
    Desai Munda claimed that after he returned home, villagers informed him that his nephew Sagar Munda had abducted his son. When Kanu was nowhere to be found, Desai lodged the FIR.
Khunti Sub-divisional Police Officer Amit Kumar led a team of police to arrest Sagar Munda.
Following the arrest, the torso was found in Kumang Gopla forest, and the head 15 km away in the Dulwa Tungri area, Murhu police station officer-in-charge Chudamani Tudu was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.

Six mobile phones, two sharp blood-stained weapons, an axe and an SUV, were seized, Tudu said.

For a long time, there had been tension over land between the families of the deceased and the accused, which led the accused to commit the beheading, the officer added.

    description: `A woman's dismembered body was found in a drum inside a locked-up rented space in Andhra Pradesh's Vishakhapatnam. The half-decomposed body of the woman is suspected to have been in this condition, locked up, for over a year. At present, officials are in the endeavour to identify the woman and unearth the eerie crime akin to the Shraddha Walkar murder case.

    The body was discovered by the landlord, who entered the house because the tenant had not been around. Sources said that the owner entered the house forcefully to clear the belongings of the tenant. The incident came to light on Monday
    The owner of the rented space said that in June 2021, the tenant vacated the house without paying the dues, on the pretext of his wife's pregnancy and expenses. It is further suspected that the tenant made a discreet entry from the back door after vacating the house yet hadn't paid his dues to the owner.
    It was only after a duration of a year that the owner forcefully entered the house to clear the belongings of the tenant when he found the body parts of a woman in a drum.

The police have registered a case and identification of the woman is underway.
